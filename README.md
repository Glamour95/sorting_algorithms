Sorting Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate file and is accompanied by a readme file explaining the algorithm and its time complexity.

1. Bubble Sort
Description
The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts an array of integers in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

The prototype of the bubble_sort function is as follows:
void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
The function takes an array of integers and its size as parameters and sorts the array in place.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "sort.h"

int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {19, 48, 99, 71, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7};
    size_t n = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    print_array(array, n);
    printf("\n");
    bubble_sort(array, n);
    printf("\n");
    print_array(array, n);

    return 0;
}
Output:
19, 48, 99, 71, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7

19, 48, 71, 99, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7
